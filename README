This project is a 4 state cellular automaton, similar to James Conway's Game of Life. But rather than just having one species, it shows the interactions of plants, prey, predators in an environment.

The goals of the project:
- to learn the ideas of object oriented programming (my first oop)
- to learn about the function in the opengl library
- to practice general coding skills

The program used:
- the opengl library for graphics
